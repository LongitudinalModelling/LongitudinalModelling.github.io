### **Does your study have data on fertility treatment?**

  <p>The <b>Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Health Partnership (A.R.T-HEALTH<sub>PARTNERSHIP</sub>)</b> is a global research collaboration led by the University of Bristol that is dedicated to building robust evidence on the effects of pregnancy conception by ART compared to unassisted conception.</p>
  <p>Our mission is to understand how fertility treatments impact the health of mothers and their children, from pregnancy through to early adulthood.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, we bring together data from a wide range of study designsâ€”including birth cohorts, ART clinical cohorts, and electronic health record linkage studies, and use different statistical approaches to build a comprehensive picture.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to leverage the strengths of each study type to get the most accurate results possible.</p>

## Why Your Study Should Join

Over the last 30 years, the use of ART has grown significantly, and today, approximately **1 in 6 couples** experience infertility. Despite its widespread use, questions remain about the long-term health outcomes for mothers and their children. Research has suggested potential health issues during pregnancy, birth, and later in life.

By joining the ART-HEALTH Partnership, your study can help us provide clear, definitive answers.

* **Reassure couples:** When our research shows no adverse effects of ART on maternal and child health, we can provide much-needed reassurance to couples undergoing treatment.
* **Prevent adverse effects:** When we do identify potential health risks, we can begin to research and develop strategies to prevent them.

Joining the partnership is a unique opportunity to contribute to this critical and high-impact field of research.

### Benefits of Joining

* **Contribute to high-impact research:** Your data will be part of powerful collaborative studies and meta-analyses.
* **Opportunities for co-authorship:** Partner studies are invited to co-author meta-analyses and other publications resulting from this collaboration.
* **Propose your own projects:** All cohort leaders can propose their own projects and lead collaborative studies.
* **Collaborate with global experts:** Connect and work with leading researchers from around the world.
