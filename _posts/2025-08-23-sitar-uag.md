We are establishing a User Advisory Group (UAG) to help maximise the impact and benefit of a new MRC-funded research project: **SITAR enhancements to support state-of-the-art analysis of individual growth curves and their correlates**.

We are looking for researchers and stakeholders that are **working or interested in longitudinal data analysis methods and applications** to join the project's UAG. Your feedback will be sought when developing our methods, tools, and disseminating results and resources to ensure that the project's outputs are made widely accessible and impactful.
