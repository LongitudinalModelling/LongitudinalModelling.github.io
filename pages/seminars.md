<div class="container mb-4">
  <p>We host online seminars on longitudinal modelling with speakers from both methodological and applied research. The seminars are open to all, including external researchers, and we welcome proposals from researchers and students to present: an excellent chance to gain feedback on ongoing work.</p>
  
  Seminar sessions are held on Teams, usually on a Thursday at 1 PM (UK), and run for up to one hour, with ~30 minutes of presentation followed by discussion.

            <dd class="col-sm-9">Because no single U.S. cohort spans the entire life course, researchers increasingly rely on data combination approaches (e.g., pooling, integration, fusion) that leverage multiple, age-overlapping cohorts covering different life stages to construct life course data. When the analytic goal in the combined cohort is exposure–disease effect estimation, such approaches require attention to causal assumptions, and principles from data fusion theory can guide cohort construction. This seminar reviews conditions under which such cohort fusion is possible (Kezios et al. 2024. Epidemiology) and presents an applied example that creates a longitudinal synthetic cohort by fusing the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and Health and Retirement Study cohorts to estimate the effect of income volatility across adulthood on later memory decline.</dd>

### Past Seminars

<p class="mt-4 text-center">You can find the recordings of some of our past seminars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LongModel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

**26 September 2025**

**Title:** **Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to describe longitudinal data**

**Speaker:** *Corentin Segalas (Bordeaux Population Health)*

**Summary:** In this talk, the functional data analysis framework will be introduced and we will see how FPCA - one of its central tools - may be used to describe biomedical longitudinal data. Finally, a simulation study that investigates FPCA robustness to various missing data scenarios will be discussed

**06 February 2025 (2 speakers)**

**Title:** **SITAR enhancements to support state-of-the-art analysis of individual growth curves and their correlates**

**Speaker:** *Ahmed Elhakeem (UOB)*

**Summary:** I will present the aims and objectives for my New Investigator Research Grant, which are to develop and test methodology for a) SITAR to model post-peak growth, b) a Bayesian SITAR model, c) joint SITAR and outcome/exposure models, and to develop and test R (& DataSHIELD) packages to implement these methods and develop resources and guidance for researchers

**Title:** **Bayesian Implementation of Superimposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) Growth Model: An Introduction to the 'bsitar' R Package**

**Speaker:** *Satpal Sandhu (UOB)*

**Summary:** To enhance the utility of the SITAR model, we have developed the 'bsitar' R package, which implements the Bayesian version of the SITAR model. The objective of this presentation is to provide an overview of the 'bsitar' package and demonstrate some of its capabilities

**31 October 2024**

**Title:** **Joint modelling of non-time to event longitudinal data: a systematic review and case-study on height and weight**

**Speaker:** *Rehema Ouko (LSHTM)*

**Summary:** Joint Bayesian modelling approach is feasible for modelling growth data and incorporates correlation between measurements. In longitudinal studies, it can be used in the case of missing data for two or more correlated variables of interest. Therefore, there is a potential benefit of using joint modelling of repeated measurements leveraging its advantages

**06 March 2024**

**Title:** **Derivative curve estimation in longitudinal studies using P-splines**

**Speaker:** *Marìa Alejandra Hernàndez Velandia (BCAM)*

**Summary:** In this presentation, we will explore the use of P-spline models for estimating derivatives within the framework of longitudinal data analysis. The main contribution lies in adding an extra penalty on the coefficients of both the population curves and the individual deviations of the model. This integration focuses on issues of under-smoothing and boundary problems in derivative estimation. The problem is interesting because derivative estimation is valuable for describing individuals' biological features or identifying change regions of interest. As an illustration, we will showcase an application involving longitudinal height measurements in teenagers to analyze their growth and maturity patterns over time.

**31 January 2024**

**Title:** **Weight trajectories through adulthood and prostate cancer: a two-stage approach to the analysis of longitudinal and survival data**

**Speaker:** *Marisa da Silva (Lund University)*

**Summary:** The Obesity and Disease Development Sweden (ODDS) study is a pooled cohort including over 4 million individuals with 9 million observations. We sampled ~250 000 men with repeated weight observations to estimate life and age span weight trajectories and used the parameters in a survival model. I will present our model building process and some of the discussions behind the steps.
